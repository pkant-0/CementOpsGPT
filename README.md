CementOpsGPT – GenAI for Smarter Cement Manufacturing

CementOpsGPT is a generative AI platform designed to optimize cement production by addressing inefficiencies in raw material handling, pyro-processing, and equipment troubleshooting. Inspired by the kiln dry pyro-processing system, our solution integrates AI models to simulate ideal operating conditions, predict failures, and assist plant operators with contextual guidance.

USP of the Solution
🔥 Process-Aware Optimization: Tailored to the dry kiln pyro-processing system used in cement manufacturing.

🧠 GenAI Troubleshooting Assistant: Helps operators resolve issues like oversized clinker nodules or improper fuel mix.

📷 Raw Material Analyzer: Uses computer vision to classify limestone and clinker sizes for better grinding and homogenization.

🌱 Sustainability Insights: Suggests alternative fuels and process tweaks to reduce CO₂ emissions.

Prototype (Simplest Version with 2 Working Features)
I’ve built a basic web app using Gradio and deployed it on Hugging Face Spaces. It includes:

🔥 Feature 1: Kiln Optimization Simulator
Input: Desired cement type (OPC/PPC), raw material composition

Output: Suggested kiln temperature, fuel mix, and feed rate

💬 Feature 2: Troubleshooting Assistant
Input: Operator query (e.g., “Clinker nodules too large”)

Output: Step-by-step guidance using GenAI trained on cement manuals
