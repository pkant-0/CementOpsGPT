# CementOpsGPT
CementOpsGPT is a GenAI-powered assistant designed to optimize cement manufacturing using the dry kiln pyro-processing method. It helps plant operators improve fuel efficiency, reduce clinker defects, and troubleshoot operational issues using generative simulations and AI-guided recommendations.
1. ðŸ§  Brief About the Solution
CementOpsGPT is a GenAI-powered assistant designed to optimize cement manufacturing using the dry kiln pyro-processing method. It helps plant operators improve fuel efficiency, reduce clinker defects, and troubleshoot operational issues using generative simulations and AI-guided recommendations.

2. ðŸŒŸ USP of the Solution
ðŸ”¥ Kiln Optimization Simulator: Suggests ideal temperature, feed rate, and fuel mix based on cement type and raw material.

ðŸ’¬ Troubleshooting Assistant: AI chatbot trained on cement manuals and logs to guide operators through common issues.

ðŸ“· (Optional Expansion) Raw Material Analyzer: Classifies limestone and clinker sizes using computer vision.

3. ðŸ§ª Prototype (Colab + Hugging Face)
Weâ€™ll build the prototype in a Colab notebook and deploy it using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces. It will include:
A. Kiln Optimization Simulator
B. Troubleshooting Assistant
C. Gradio Interface
